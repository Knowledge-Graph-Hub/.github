## Welcome to Knowledge-Graph-Hub ðŸ‘‹

KG-Hub, a platform that provides software development patterns for the standardized construction, exchange, and reuse of knowledge graphs. Features include a simple, modular extract-transform-load (ETL) pattern for ingest of upstream data in a Biolink-model compliant manner, cached downloads of upstream data, versioned and automatically updated builds, web-browsable storage of KG artifacts on cloud infrastructure, easy reuse of transformed subgraphs of upstream data across different projects, and easy integration of any OBO ontology.
